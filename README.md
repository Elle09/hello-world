Hello? No response...
Write a bit about myself?
The world turns silent.

I am not a poet but that was a Haiku. I'm engaged to my best friend. I work at a veterinary lab. I want to pursue the software development class. They say if it's not scary it's not worth it. I say the devil is in the details, but so does success.
